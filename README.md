For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.jsx` is the JavaScript entry point.

You may create subdirectories inside src.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## Installing a Dependency

You can install any dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save react-router
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-router
```

## Testing
To run the tests, run the following command:

npm test

This will run the Jest test suite for the project. All tests should pass, and any new features should have corresponding tests added.
